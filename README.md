### Project Description

The web app was created to experiment with some of the features of Typescript and the HTML5 drag and drop leveraging the React.js library.

The app enables the users to create and manage bare-bone Kanban boards. It is possible to access the boards in future sessions thanks to the use of the browser's local storage.

You can check out the live app here:
